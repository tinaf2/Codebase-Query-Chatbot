# Codebase-Query-Chatbot

## Overview
**Codebase Query Chatbot** enables developers to interact with their codebase through a chatbot interface, providing answers based on the code's context. Built with **React.js** for the frontend and **FastAPI** for the backend, this project integrates **Pinecone** for fast vector search and utilizes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered by a **Large Language Model (LLM)** for enhanced query responses. The system is optimized for embedding individual functions instead of entire files to improve accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Query your codebase via an intuitive React.js frontend.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Handles user queries and integrates with Pinecone for fast and accurate search.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines context retrieval and **LLM**-powered responses to deliver highly relevant answers.
- **Function-Level Embeddings**: Focus on embedding individual functions rather than entire files for more precise and relevant query results.
- **Scalable and Optimized**: Built to handle large codebases and provide fast responses.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, Axios, React Router
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pinecone, Langchain, Pydantic, Groq, Sentence-Transformers
- **Development Tools**: Git, Docker, Python 3.10, Node.js, npm
